                    Therefore, when introducing this mod, it is advisable to deposit all possessions in a safe place and perform a respawn. <br>Please be careful during installation.<br>

                <p class="text02">
                    Let's move on to the MOD explanation.<br>This MOD is currently under development. <br>It is designed to enhance the graphic environment of Ark and ensure smooth operation even on low-spec PCs.
                    When using it, please press the F8 key. <br>First, try pressing ALL IN. With just this, you should notice significant changes in graphics and optimization. <br>For those who simply want to make things faster and have issues with their GPU, this might be all you need.<br>Additionally, as a side note, since it seems that manipulating the gamma value does not work, I have set it for use with the fixed functions of F1 and F2.<br>
                    <br>-To Japanese Users-<br><br>Currently, there are several issues confirmed to occur only in the Japanese environment, and problems are indeed arising. <br>One of them is a mysterious bug where, after pressing the F8 key for UI display input during debugging, F8 stops working after several seconds to minutes.<br>After careful consideration, it has been determined that addressing this bug within the MOD is almost impossible.<br><br>As a workaround, it seems that installing and applying the <span><a href="https://www.google.co.jp/ime/" alt="keyboard link" target="_blank">Google Keyboard</a></span> from this source resolves this bug in my development environment. <br>I hope users can apply this solution on their end.<br>While we are still addressing issues in this recently released game, we appreciate your understanding and patience. The remaining detailed features will be explained in the section below.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p class="text02">
                    <h3>Functional explanation</h3>
                </p>

                <p class="text02">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="dot">
                            Hide Nearby Actors
                            <p class="text02">
                                Mainly, this feature will render objects, excluding buildings near survivors containing wood and gatherable items, invisible. <br>This is an unavoidable process for graphic improvement, and these objects are not actually destroyed and disappear. <br>They just become invisible. <br>Large rocks and trees may seem to have disappeared at first glance, but they do exist in those locations.<br>
                                <br>Therefore, when flying on creatures like Argentavis, be cautious as you may collide with these objects if they were present. <br>Rexes walking on rocks may appear to be floating.<br>
                                This feature could be useful when searching for specific dinosaurs.<br>
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="text02">
                                Contrary to 'Hide Nearby Actors,' this feature renders distant objects invisible. <br>Although they may occasionally be visible during loading, they will become invisible again after a while.<br>
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="text02">
                                You can lower the quality even more than the low-quality settings available in the regular ARK user settings. <br>This is primarily suitable for those who want to speed up their game performance at all costs.<br>
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="text02">
                                'r.VolumetricCloud 0' and 'Fog 0' have similar behavior, but in reality, this setting may be slightly lighter as it also consolidates the invisibility of finer details, such as child elements.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            Compression Nanite Meshes and Textures
                            <p class="text02">
                                This is currently applied only to the red obelisk. <br>The fundamental mesh vertices are reduced to about 1/20, and textures are compressed from 8K and 4K classes to 512px, minimizing the impact on appearance. <br>This is a very labor-intensive process, so please be patient. <br>We will continue to add this to other areas in future updates.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="dot">
                            Erase All Shadow
                            <p class="text02">
                                It behaves the same as 'r.ShadowQuality 0'.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            FXAA and NoMSAA Anti-Aliasing
                            <p class="text02">
                                It reverts the anti-aliasing method to the one used in the ASE era. <br>However, the effect may not be significant, and it produces noticeable jagged edges, so I personally do not recommend it. <br>It may be removed in future updates.<br>
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="text02">
                                The content I highly recommend in this MOD is as follows. <br>It recreates the compression mesh and material for the sea, replacing them without significantly altering the appearance. <br>It behaves differently from 'r.Water.SingleLayer.Reflection 0,' and even with optimization, you should be able to observe reflections and waves normally. <br>Additionally, you can apply 'r.Water.SingleLayer.Reflection 0' with a command, but I believe it's become unnecessary when combined with others. <br>If you really want to make it a bit lighter, feel free to use it at your discretion.<br>

                            <p class="text02">
                                You can apply console commands that may relatively lighten the load in one go. <br>These commands are mainly used for Lumen and LOD-related optimizations.<br>

                                Since the regular keyboard gamma setting wasn't available, I made one as well. <br>You can also change the value by clicking on the back numbers and typing. <br>The other details and specifications are the same as the MOD Active Key.<br>
