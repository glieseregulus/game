                    <p id="Mobile" class="text02">This page will provide a brief explanation of how to use this asset here.<br><br>When thinking about settings for different development environments and considering the specifications of the PCs that customers will use in Unreal Engine 5, I often ponder various issues.<br><br>For instance, I wonder, 'It works in my development environment, but how will it perform on lower-spec systems?' UserSettings-related problems always seem to persist. For example, not being able to discern the differences between UserSettings before and after changes, or making abrupt changes that cause the PC to become unresponsive and sluggish.<br><br>That's when I had an idea: what if you could make changes while observing their impact? I pondered this and created an asset that is as user-friendly as possible and considers the environment – and that's where 'SpinBoxSettings' comes into play.<br><br>This asset allows you to adjust settings while previewing them when you are configuring User Settings. With this, you can develop while fine-tuning your development environment and shader load.<br>

                    <p class="text02">Contents - SpinBoxSettings - Please open the WG_Settings widget.<br>When you want to add additional options, it is recommended to add items to the Vertical Box inside the Designer's hierarchy.<br>Also, inside the SpinBoxGraph in the graph, you will find the main SpinBox nodes, so if you want to add custom items, setting up nodes in a similar way may be a good idea.
