                    <p id="Mobile" class="text02">This page will provide a brief explanation of how to use this asset here.<br><br>In the initial setup, swiping is configured for camera rotation, while pinching is set for zooming.<br><br>This asset is a project designed for easy mobile interface creation.<br> While developing a mobile game project, I found adjusting it for real device debugging to be quite cumbersome. <br>It took quite a bit of time and was very frustrating.<br> Additionally, the touch interface included from the outset would sometimes cease to respond to swipes during Axis key input, making it very challenging to achieve practical functionality.<br> Therefore, I thought that even for such a simple project, there might be people who would want to use it when developing mobile projects.<br><br> And that's how it led to the sale of this asset.<br> It's surprisingly uncommon, isn't it? <br>Mobile assets for UE5. <br><br>So, please check this out first.<br>
                    </p>

                <p class="text01">Please check the red area. <br><br>Pinch operation cannot be performed if this is not set correctly.<br>The 'TouchInterface' set here is located within '/Game/SwipeAndPinch/Input'.<br></p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="text01">Regarding the red circle in the bottom right,<br> it's set to 'Jump' for easier handling in the initial third-person template.<br> <br>Feel free to adjust this setting according to the project you want to create.<br>It might be suitable to set it as the attack button or something similar. <br><br>In this asset, the button processing is not implemented in the interface settings but rather through widget buttons. <br>Please refer to '/Game/SwipeAndPinch/Blueprint/WG_JumpButton' for details. <br><br>Additionally, for clarity, we've created assets specifically for interface settings in this instance, but you can also customize and use the engine content 'DefaultVirtualJoysticks' and 'LeftVirtualJoystickOnly' that are used by default when creating a project. <br>Feel free to explore them if needed.</p>

                <p class="text02">Game - Demo -　ThirdPerson - Input - IMC_Default This is Action Mappings Context.<br><br>This has been modified as shown in the following image.<br> Please refer to it when making changes or creating a new project.<br><br>

                <p class="text02">Game - Demo -　ThirdPerson - Blueprints - BP_ThirdPersonCharacter<br><br>
                This third-person character also has additional nodes added. <br>These are for calculating the starting and movement values of where the touch occurred during Tick, in order to add camera rotation. <br><br>For example, when transplanting to other projects, be sure to add this to the third-person character.<br>

                    <p class="text02"><h3>Notes on asset usage</h3></p>
                    <p class="text02">Although not included in this asset, UE5's standard gesture features also include flick and rotation functionalities.<br> However, they are not integrated into this asset because I couldn't find suitable use cases for them. <br><br>Additionally, incorporating touch interfaces from other sources may lead to conflicts if used extensively, so please be cautious of potential issues when adding additional elements for users.<br></p>
